      %h1 Microscopic buoyancy measured by pressure gauges
    .description
      %p
        The fifth test of the pressure gauge is to install two gauges on the opposite
        sides of the container, apply a potential gradient, and check if the
        measurements on the gauges reflect the effect of the gradient. A perfect example
        is to measure the buoyancy of microfluids using two gauges.
      %p
        The following experiment is set up to prove the existence of buoyancy at the
        microscopic level under a condition of extraordinary gravity. The system is a
        mixture composed of two types of molecules, represented by the blue and green
        particles. The blue particles have a larger radius but a smaller mass, and their
        number is relatively fewer than that of the green ones (assume that the green
        ones are water and the blue ones are plastic). A gauge is installed on the
        bottom surface of an obstacle fixed at the top of the container. Another one is
        installed on the top surface of an obstacle fixed at the bottom of the
        container. The two gauges measure the partial pressure of the blue particles
        (the Ws particles), and the total pressure. The periodic boundary condition is
        applied in the horizontal direction to eliminate the boundary effect.

        Important: If you care about getting more reliable results, increase the recorder
        length to at least 500 frames (set this under the &quot;Recorder&quot; tab in the
        Preferences dialog).
      %p
        The gravity (g=20 m/s2, about twice as much as the gravitational acceleration on the
        surface of the Earth) is initially on. Run the simulation until the tape is full and
        compare the pressure readings on the two gauges. Then turn off the gravity, and repeat
        the simulation.
      %p
        The simulation result shows a striking agreement with reality: Although the bottom
        gauge measures a higher pressure than does the top gauge under gravity (this is
        consistent to the well-known barometric formula that states pressure decreases with
        respect to altitude), the partial pressure measured by the bottom gauge is lower than
        that by the top gauge! This means the probability of finding a blue particle is higher
        at the top than at the bottom. If we turn off the gravity, we will measure
        approximately the same total pressures and the same partial pressure at the top and at
        the bottom. Hence, the existence of buoyancy at the atomic level is proven.
      %p
        In fact, the molecular picture for buoyancy is quite straightforward. As we know, a
        thermodynamical system seeks for reducing its free energy. The potential energy of the
        system lowers when: (1) heavier molecules occupy the lower part of the container; (2)
        smaller molecules occupy the lower part of the container. The second situation lowers
        the potential energy because more mass will be in the lower part as we can stack up
        more smaller molecules. The combination of (1) and (2) is the mass density. The entire
        process of molecules exchanging their positions up and down never ends at finite
        temperature, which allows the system to settle down at an equilibrium if it is not
        already equilibrated.
      %p
        Again, this is a nice proof that a macroscopic phenomenon can ALWAYS be explained
        using atomic-scale reasoning, with the aid of a computer to simulate an ensemble of a
        reasonable size (something hard for us but easy for computers).

        The results of a set of reference simulations carried out by the author are reported
        below (only the partial pressures are shown, the total pressures are not shown because
        the result is clear for them):

        The cummulative running averages of the measured partial pressures for the blue
        particles. The left figure is the result for the case when the gravity is on. The
        right one is that for the case when the gravity is off. In the figures, the red ones
        are the partial pressures for the blue particles measured by the top gauge, the other
        ones are those measured by the bottom gauge. The result that the top gauge measures
        higher partial pressure than does the bottom gauge can be attributed to buoyancy.
      %p
        The simulations were carried out for about 1 million femtoseconds (a nanosecond) in
        the case when the gravity is turned on, and for about 2 million femtoseconds in the
        case of zero gravity. The result of the first simulation seems clear --- there is an
        evident difference between the measured partial pressures that is caused by buoyancy.
        The result of the second simulation shows that some small difference between the
        measured partial pressures, which should ideally be exactly identical. To get some
        more confidence for this result, we also provide the result for the partial pressures
        in the time window from 0 to 1 nanosecond, which shows that the small disagreement
        should probably be considered as normal fluctuations for such a small system instead
        of a serious disagreement with the theory. On the same page where that result is
        displayed, we also show the perfect energy conservation graphs for the simulations of
        both situations, which is a convincing evidence indicating that everything has gone
        well in both simulations.
      %p
        Your results do not need to be exactly identical, but should match at a qualitative
        level.
